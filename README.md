# Interactive Enrichment Analysis

This project provides user-friendly interactive tools to perform
enrichment analysis for multiple datasets across multiple public
databases. The instructions below describe how to run these tools 
and all of their features.

*tldr; Just perform the **bold, bullet list items** below to get up and
running fast.*

## Installation

You only have to do this once. Skip this if you've already done this recently.

-   **[Install the latest versions of R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 
Follow the steps provided on that page and then return here.**

*Note: At a minimum you will need the version of R required by [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/).*

## Launch

The `launch_app.R` script will check your R dependencies and launch an interactive session.

-   **Open RStudio**
-   **Copy/paste these lines into the Console and hit return:**

```
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages(c("devtools","httr")); library(devtools); library(httr)
options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowExternal)
source_url("https://raw.github.com/gladstone-institutes/Interactive-Enrichment-Analysis/main/launch_app.R")
```

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_run_launch.png" width="600" />

This will install some basic dependencies, download the project to your Working 
Directory (*Files* tab in RStudio) and launch the tool in your browser.

*Advanced: Alternatively, you can `git clone` this repo and periodically
perform `git pull` to update the code and database collections. Install the 
minimal dependencies listed in `launch_app.R` and launch from RStudio (i.e., 
open any of the `shiny_run/app/` files and choose `Run App > Run in Window`*

## Databases

A collection of public databases is provided and updated monthly as a
datestamped (YYYYMMDD) RData file, e.g., `20210108.RData`. [Cite](#how-to-cite)
and provide this file for reproducible research. Download updated
versions (or perform `git pull`) to access the latest content from
public databases.

-   **In the *Databases* panel, choose a database collection.**

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_run_db.png" width="200" align="left" />

The app will take a moment to load the databases, check their validity,
and list them for your review. This step is complete when you see ✔
**Ready!**

*Advanced: If you want to construct your own database collection, then
add one or more GMT files with NCBI gene identifiers to 
`shiny_run/databases/gmts/` and choose BUILD NEW DATABASE in the Databases 
panel.*

*Pro-tip: Between projects, be sure to update your RData or GMT files as
new versions are released.*
<br /><br />

## Datasets

A sample dataset `E-GEOD-30573.csv` ([Voineagu
2011](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/21614001)) is provided to
illustrate the required format. *A `gene` column is always required.*
Columns named `rank`, `p.value`, and `fold.change` (log2FoldChange) are also recognized
for additional analysis options. All other columns are ignored.

-   **In the *Datasets* panel, choose one more more datasets to analyze
    or choose ADD NEW DATASETS to upload your own CSV files.**

You can choose as many dataset files as you like as long *as they are
all of the same format*. Datasets with different formats should be
analyzed in separate runs.

#### Format

The supported formats include:

     - a simple list of genes (for ORA only)
     - a list of genes with a `rank` column (for GSEA only)
     - a list of genes with a `p.value` column (for GSEA and ORA)
     - a list of genes with `p.value` and `fold.change` columns (for GSEA
    and ORA)

*Caution: For a given run, all datasets are assumed to have the same
format. If you have different types of dataset files (per the list
above), then you should run them in separate batches.*

#### Preview and Options

The app will display a preview of the first few rows of the first chosen
dataset along with the required and optional columns it could detect
(see table and subsequent message in screenshot).

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_run_ds.png" width="200" align="left"/>

**Identifiers**

Supported gene identifiers include SYMBOL, ENSEMBL, ENTREZID, and
UNIPROT, by default. But it is trivial to add support for [any orgDb
keytypes](http://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/useful-utilities.html).
Simply edit the `supported.idTypes` list in the "Defaults and
Parameters" section of `shiny_run/app/global.R`.

**Organisms**

Supported species include human and mouse, by default. In order 
to add support for [any orgDb
species](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___OrgDb), 
edit the `supported.org` list in the "Defaults and Parameters"
section of `shiny_run/app/global.R` and generate a collection of databases from
GMTs with NCBI Gene identifiers.

**Gene set min/max**

These options are defined by
[clusterProfiler](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/clusterProfiler/man/clusterProfiler.pdf#Rfn.enricher.1)
and are used to prune the databases, restricting the gene sets
considered in the analysis based on their size, e.g., excluding gene
sets with fewer than 3 genes or more than 500 genes.

**ORA Cutoffs**

If ORA is to be performed, then `fold.change` and `p.value` cutoffs must
be supplied. These are used to define the subset of significantly
changed genes to test against all other genes in the dataset.

At the bottom of the panel, the "Analysis plan" will state which
analyses will be performed. The app performs all possible analyses. This
step is complete when you see ✔ **Ready!**

## Run Analyses

When *Databases* and *Datasets* are loaded and verified, a third step
will appear in the side panel.

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_run_go.png" width="150"/>

If the analysis plan looks good to you, including all the parameter
choices, then...

-   **Click `Let's go!`**

The initial set of panels will collapse and a new *Progress* panel will
open along with a progress bar in the lower-right corner.

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_run_progress.png" width="300" align="left"/>

<br />
The *Progress* panel will enumerate the steps and report any errors
along the way. In general, the steps include: installing required R
libraries, preprocessing of each dataset, and performing ORA and/or GSEA
for each dataset against each database.

It will also report the start and finish times for the run, and the
location of the output folder that is given a unique timestamp-based
name to support multiple independent runs.

This step is complete when you see ✔ **Finished!**

<br /><br />
Two buttons will be presented at the completion of each run:

-   **Click `View Results` to launch a shiny app for interactively
    viewing results, or click `Start new analysis` to reset the app for
    another run.**

*Advanced: Results are organized under `shiny_results/output/` in a run-specific folder named by
timestamp with subfolders for `gsea` and `ora` results, each of which
includes a folder of `plots`. Results include TSV and XLSX tables of
enriched terms and pathway, as well as RDS versions of the complete
input and output for each clusterProfiler run and a log file. Plots
include volcano, dot, cnet, heatmap, upset, and more.*

## View Results

A second shiny app is allows you to interactively explore results and
download individual files. Its side panel is organized in the same way
as the output folders.

To relaunch the results app at any time, navigate to the top-level directory and
-   **Copy/paste these lines into the Console and hit return:**

```
options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowExternal)
source("view_results.R")
```

#### **Data Tab**

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_data_ora.png" width="600" />

For a given run, dataset and method (see side panel), the *Data* tab
displays the processed input data as a table (left) and volcano plot
(right). The table is paginated and supports search, filtering and
download as Excel, CSV or to clipboard. The volcano plot uses the
user-specified `fold.change` and `p.value` cutoffs (for ORA) and can
also be downloaded. A checkbox near the top of the panel allows you to
also view the genes that were excluded from the analysis, e.g., due to
failed identifier mapping.

*Pro-tip: View the excluded data rows to assess whether the exclusions
are resolvable (e.g., fixing identifiers in your dataset CSV) and
substantial (e.g., a lot of significant genes per the volcano plot).*

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_data_volcano.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Volcano plot**

Using [EnhancedVolcano](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EnhancedVolcano.html),
a volcano plot of your input data highlights subsets of genes based on the p.value
and fold-change cutoffs indicated during the run. Plot options includes:
 * `Top n genes` - How many genes to label in the plot (ignored if genes names are entered)
 * `Enter genes by name` - A list of gene names with auto-populated choices from the top 20 (overrides `Top n genes`)
 * `Label font size` - Font size for gene labels
 * `Legend position` - Placement of the legend
 <br/><br/><br/><br/>
 
<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_data_bar.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Bar plot (Data)**

Using ggplot2::geom_bar,
a bar plot of your input data highlights positive and negative fold-change values for a subset of genes. Plot options includes:
 * `Top n genes` - How many genes to include in the plot (ignored if genes names are entered)
 * `Enter genes by name` - A list of gene names with auto-populated choices from the top 20 (overrides `Top n genes`)
 * `Label font size` - Font size for all text
 * `Legend position` - Placement of the legend
 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

#### **Results Tab**

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_res_gsea.png" width="600" />

Per selected database (see the top drop-down menu), the *Results* tab
displays a table of enriched terms and pathways, a plot of top results
(left), and a plot of a selected result (right) from the table (above).
The table is paginated and supports selection, search, filtering and
download as Excel, CSV or to clipboard. The plots for top results
include dot (by Gene Ratio or by Count), emap, concept networks, etc.,
and can also be downloaded. The plots for individual, selected results
include GSEA score (for GSEA), database-specific views and linkouts, and
more, and can also be downloaded.

*Pro-tip: Navigate between GSEA and ORA methods (side panel) while
viewing the results for a particular database to explore hits in common
(and unique) to the different methods.*

<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_res_dot.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Dot plot**

Using [enrichplot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/enrichplot.html),
a dot plot of results highlight multiple statistics for the most enriched results. Plot options includes:
 * `Top n results` - How many results to include in the plot
 * `X-axis by` - Set the x-axis by Count (*number of dataset genes overlapping a given term*) or GeneRatio (*dataset genes overlapping a given term vs all possible terms*)
 * `Size by` - Set the size of dots by Count, GeneRatio, or Percentage (*dataset genes overlapping a given term vs all genes in term*)
 * `Wrap labels` - Wrap long labels to mulitple lines after a specified number of characters
 * `Label font size` - Font size for all text
 * `Color by` - Set the color of dots by pvalue, p.adjust, or qvalue (see [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) docs)
  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
  
<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_res_bar.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Bar plot (Results)**

Using ggplot2::geom_bar,
a bar plot of results highlight various statistics for the most enriched results. Plot options includes:
 * `Top n results` - How many results to include in the plot
 * `X-axis by` - Set the x-axis by Fold change (*average fold change of overlapping genes*), Count (*number of dataset genes overlapping a given term*) or Percentage (*dataset genes overlapping a given term vs all genes in term*)
 * `Wrap labels` - Wrap long labels to mulitple lines after a specified number of characters
 * `Label font size` - Font size for all text
 <br/><br/><br/><br/>
 
<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_res_heatmap.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Heatmap**

Using ggplot2::geom_tile,
a heatmap of results highlights overlapping genes among the most enriched results. 
Plot options includes:
 * `Top n results` - How many results to include in the heatmap analysis (will 
 exclude results without shared genes)
  * `Top n genes` - How many genes to include in the heatmap, ordered by number
  of shared results and secondarily by fold.change.
 * `Wrap labels` - Wrap long labels to mulitple lines after a specified number of characters
 * `Label font size` - Font size for result labels (y-axis)
 * `Gene font size` - Font size for gene labels (x-axis)
 <br/><br/><br/>
 
<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_res_emap.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Enrichment map (emap)**

Using [enrichplot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/enrichplot.html),
an enrichment map connects results with overlapping genes. 
Plot options includes:
 * `Top n results` - How many results to include in the heatmap analysis (will 
 exclude results without shared genes)
 * `Wrap labels` - Wrap long labels to mulitple lines after a specified number of characters
 * `Label font size` - Font size for node labels
 * `Result node scale` - Relative scale factor for the size of nodes
 * `Color by` - Set the color of dots by pvalue, p.adjust, or qvalue (see [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) docs)
 * `Layout` - Layout algorithm to apply to network. Layout names are rarely
 descriptive, so just try them out!
 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
 
<img src="shiny_run/assets/shiny_results_res_cnet.png" width="400" align="left"/>

**Concept network (cnet)**

Using [enrichplot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/enrichplot.html),
a concept network connects results via their overlapping genes. 
Plot options includes:
 * `Top n results` - How many results to include in the heatmap analysis (will 
 exclude results without shared genes)
 * `Label font size` - Font size for category labels
 * `Gene font size` - Font size for gene nodes
 * `Result node scale` - Relative scale factor for the size of result nodes
 * `Gene node scale` - Relative scale factor for the size of gene nodes
 * `Layout` - Layout algorithm to apply to network. Layout names are rarely
 descriptive, so just try them out!
 * `Circular` - Force a circular layout *(pretty useless)*
 * `colorEdge` - Color the connections by result
 <br/><br/><br/><br/>
 
**PDF export**

All plots offer `PDF options` to control the aspect ratio and initial dimensions
(in pixels) of the saved PDF image. PDF images, of course, are vector graphics, 
so you can zoom in to the final image as much as you want. These are 
publication-ready images.

## Publishing

You are free to use all the files produced by this tool in your research
and publications. Again, an initial set of plots, tables and RDS files
is automatically generated in `shiny_result/output/…` and you can also
download individual tables and plots from the interactive app.

In addition, the project is structured to facilitate sharing
your results along with the interactive app! All the necessary files are
maintained under the `shiny_result` folder. Share this folder (e.g., as
a zip file, Dropbox or Box), or upload it to a cloud-hosted service
(e.g., [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)) and share a simply
URL. ***This is the best way to publish your enrichment results,
allowing other researchers to browse your full results in spite of the
limited space in publications.***

## Troubleshooting
1. Error at launch
```
  Error in runUrl(url, subdir = subdir, destdir = destdir, ...) :
  Failed to download URL https://github.com/gladstone-institutes/Interactive-Enrichment-Analysis/archive/HEAD.tar.gz
```
 * Solution: Your working directory may be set to a read-only dir, e.g., "/". Try setting it to your user dir.

2. Error running GSEA
```
  Warning: Error in preparePathwaysAndStats: Not all stats values are finite numbers
```
 * Solution: You may have invalid p.values, e.g., zero is not an acceptable p.value. Replace these cases with a p.value smaller than any other in your dataset, then try again.

3. Dataset not working or GSEA not offered as option
 * Solution:  Double check that your columns names are exactly: `gene` `fold.change` and `p.value`. Other names will not be recognized by the tool.

4. Error running ORA
```
  Error in <Anonymous>: 'geneSets' is not a slot in class "NULL"
```
 * There are no genes that pass your significance filter criteria and ID mapping to Entrez ID. Explore your dataset in Excel to choose alternative criteria, e.g., larger p.value and/or smaller fold.change.

5. Error launching results
```
  Error in library(plyr) : there is no package called ‘plyr’
```
 * Even after loading plyr, additional errors pop up for other libs in global.R/p.load.libs. This will occur if you attempt to launch the results app BEFORE the run app.  Solution: either run the provided sample dataset prior to viewing results, or launch the results app via the script which checks for dependencies:
```
options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowExternal)
source("view_results.R")
```
